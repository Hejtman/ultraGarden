2 weeks self-sustaining aero/hydroponics system for extreme sunbeam. Ultra sound made nutrient fog circling in pipes on balcony trough plants roots. 
Extended watering by liquid watter for fully grown plants with roots reaching bottom of pipes.
  
Raspberry Pi collects information about outside light density, humidity, temperature, temperature in pipes and water + manages closed fogging, watering vs opened airing cycles for optimal plants irrigation.
